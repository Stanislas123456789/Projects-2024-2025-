# Given data:
correct_answers = 56
wrong_answers = 4

# Scoring system
score_correct = 1  # Right answers score 1 point
score_wrong = -0.25*(3)  # Wrong answers score -0.25
score_donotknow = 0  # "I don't know" scores 0, but this doesn't apply in this case

# Calculate total score
total_score = (correct_answers * score_correct) + (wrong_answers * score_wrong)

# Convert to a grade on 20
grade_out_of_20 = (total_score / (60)) * 20  # max score of 55 points for 20 out of 20
